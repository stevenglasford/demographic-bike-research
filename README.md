# Demographic Bike Research

This repository contains a simple HTML/JavaScript program designed to be used on a cellphone. The purpose is to conduct demographic research in high pedestrian areas by recording people and usage patterns while riding a bicycle.

## Project Inspiration

The inspiration for this project stems from recent discussions and trends within the city of Minneapolis. There appears to be a growing desire to remove all traffic from Nicollet Mall in Downtown Minneapolis. As a Metro Transit bus driver, I believe this move could be counterproductive, particularly for making the downtown corridor more accessible and equitable for bicycles, people with disabilities, and non-white communities.

The goal of this project is to present an accurate narrative of Nicollet Mall and its usage.

## Context and Concerns

Nicollet Mall recently underwent a $50 million renovation, transforming it into its current state. However, despite this investment, several issues remain that make the street less pleasant than intended:

* __Bus Operations__: Although Nicollet Mall is a designated bus corridor, the buses are required to move slowly, often hindered by stoplights that cause significant delays. The buses are capped at 10 mph, but due to frequent stops at every block for 12 blocks, with each stoplight causing a 30-45 second delay, buses often run 6 minutes late on average.

* __Traffic Issues__: There is a need for increased signage to indicate that Nicollet Mall is restricted to buses, bikes, and pedestrians. Currently, some vehicles still use the street, though the design intentionally slows them down.

* __Cross Traffic__: The streets crossing Nicollet Mall are oversized, designed for a capacity that far exceeds current usage. Recent traffic studies show that all crossing streets are below 10,000 people/day but were built for 45,000 people/hour. This suggests that Nicollet Mall should remain a vital pedestrian corridor, but closing it to all non-pedestrian traffic might be misguided.

**Proposal**: Instead of making Nicollet Mall pedestrian-only, better solutions might include closing most of the cross streets or converting them into two-way streets with stop signs at every intersection. This could enhance foot traffic safety and flow on Nicollet Mall.

## Study Overview

### Date and Methodology

The study was conducted originally going to be conducted on August 21, 2024, from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM, but was cut short due to more data being generated than initially expected. I still rode my e-bike up and down Nicollet Mall, counting people and other relevant metrics.  The metric I used for counting people was rather simple, the person had to be on the right of way of Nicollet Mall, and I would follow a bus (this was so I could get an accurate measurement of buses getting stuck in traffic lights). Once the bus in front of me passed a person or a person passed the bus on a bicycle, I would count that person.

### Key Findings

* __Pedestrian Activity__: Between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM, I recorded approximately 3,584 people, which was more than I initially expected.
* __Counting Challenges__: Counting was difficult, particularly with people at bus stops and the light rail station, where groups often dispersed quickly.
* __Demographic Breakdown__:
    * Total Persons: 3,584
    * Adults: 3,274
    * Children: 151
    * Seniors: 104
    * Disabled Persons: 55
    * White Persons: 1,884
    * Black Persons: 927
    * Asian Persons: 62
    * Other Races: 711
    * Non-White Presenting Persons: 1,700
    * People Walking: 2,682
    * Persons Waiting for Bus or Train: 624
    * Bikes: 278
    * White Persons Using Transit: 163

## Census Comparison

As of the 2020 census, Minneapolis had the following demographics:

* Total Population: 429,954
* White Population: 255,704 (59.47%)
* Non-White Population: 40.53%
* Children: 34,808
* Seniors: 21,180
* 4.2% of the population has an ambulatory disability

__Nicollet Mall Findings__: According to my data, the population on Nicollet Mall is 52.57% white and 47.43% non-white presenting. This indicates that Nicollet Mall is more racially diverse than the cityâ€™s average.

## Analysis of Transit and Economic Impact

* __Transit Delays__: The average bus on Nicollet Mall encounters a 58.57% chance of stopping at a light, leading to delays between 0 to 7.5 minutes. With an average of 17 people per bus, these delays contribute to significant lost economic output, particularly impacting non-white populations who represent 73.88% of transit users on Nicollet Mall.

## Conclusion

The city of Minneapolis is considering removing buses from Nicollet Mall as part of a revitalization effort. However, this study suggests that buses play a crucial role in integrating different races within the city and contribute to safer and more accessible transportation on Nicollet Mall.

__Recommendation__: Instead of removing buses, the city should focus on reducing bus pollution through the adoption of electric buses or trolleybuses. Additionally, replacing stoplights with all-way stop signs could improve bus punctuality and overall traffic flow.

__Final Thoughts__: Removing buses from Nicollet Mall could be seen as a racially inequitable action that disproportionately affects non-white communities, seniors, and people with disabilities. The city should prioritize racial equity and maintain bus services while exploring alternative traffic calming measures for the streets crossing Nicollet Mall.
