# demographic-bike-research
This repo contains a simple HTML/Javascript program that can be ran on a cellphone. The point of this is to do demographic research on high pedestrain areas, using a simple method of recording people and usage while riding a bicycle.

The inspiration of this project came from recent comments and trend within the city of Minneapolis that seem to indicate a strong affinity for the citizens to remove all traffic from Nicollet Mall in Downtown Minneapolis. I am a bus driver for Metro Transit and I have a strong feeling that this would be counter productive in making the downtown corridor better for bicycles, people with disabilities, and especially people of a different race/ethnicity other than standard white people. 

The hopes for this project is to reflect a true narritive of Nicollet Mall. 

Furthermore, Nicollet Mall received a $50 Million revamp to make it the way it is today, and even today there are several items that are missing from the street that make it unpleasant. First, this is a bus cooridor, but the buses are required to be slow, and often hit stop lights that increase delays by significant margins. The fact that the buses are capped at 10mph is not truely accurate as each bus is required to stop at every block for 12 blocks for an average of 30-45 seconds at each light. This means that on average the bus is about 6 minutes late at the end. A better and much more pleasant ride would be one in which the bus stops at each intersection, allowing people to board or disembark, but not requiring the bus to wait at the stop light. Then replacing the stop light with a simple all way stop sign. Furthermore, there needs to be increased signage for the street indicating the street is only for bus, bikes, and pedestrians. Currently people drive through, luckily most traffic is slowed down by the buses (which is actually part of the design).

Then there is the cross traffic for nicollet mall which are giant highway width roads designed for massive capacities, that simply do not exist.

Recent traffic studies show that the all of the streets that cross nicollet mall are below 10000people/day, but yet are built for 45000 people/hr. This suggests that nicollet mall should and remains to be a vital pedestrian cooridor, but the idea of making this cooridor only for pedestrains foolish. Better ideas for Nicollet mall include literally closing most of the cross streets, or converting all of the cross streets into 2 ways with stop signs at every intersection. This would provably result in higher and safer foot traffic being funneled into nicollet mall. 

Depending on the outcome of this study the removal of the buses may be a racist action that largely targets minorities, seniors, disabled people. The discussion of removing the buses from nicollet mall should be carefully analyzed and I don't see anyone else doing the work, so I shall do it.

This study will be performed on August 21st between 6am and 7pm all day long I am going to ride my bike up and down Nicollet Mall with my ebike.

# Analysis
From about 7AM to about 10PM I recorded about 3000 people. I noticed that it was actually much more busy on the mall than I initially expected.
The counting was rather difficult and I missed a significant number of people from bus stops and the light rail station. Typically the people from both modes of transport bolted away before I could count them accurately. I tried my hardest, but when the train drops off about 150 people at one time, its pretty difficult to count them accurately. This also happened often with the D line as the bus was usually full. 

Overall though the data is rather accurate however, but it might undercount the number of transit users, since it was difficult to count all commuters from bus and train dumps. Furthermore, it was difficult counting the number of elderly people, since I often couldn't tell people's age very quickly. For the most part if someone had white hair and walking slower I would count them as senior. All children under the approximate age of 15 are counted as Youth.
Bikes were very easy to count. People with obvious mobility problems (such as wheelchair use) were counted towards "disabled" category. 

There were a few people milling about, these people were counted multiple times, but can likely be filtered out with further research. For the most part though, people were on the move. Very few people waiting and milling about for leisure. I believe this is also true since the mall has very few places to sit and relax (this is a topic for further discussion for later).

Overwhelmingly I was suprised by the amount of people that I saw on this cooridor, this small slice of time does not account for people riding on buses or trains through the street. 

The methodology I used was simple, I pass by them, If they were about 15 feet from me and using the street, I counted them. I typcially just followed the buses and did not pass the buses, since doing so I would usually miss people getting off the bus/transfering buses/waiting of buses.

Between 7am and 10am on August 21, 2024 on a clear nice day this is the count that I found
Number of stray cars: 20 
Number of people: 3584
Number of adults: 3274
Number of children: 151
Number of seniors: 104
Number of disabled people: 55
Number of white people: 1884
Number of black people: 927
Number of asian people: 62
Number of other race people: 711
Number of people walking: 2682
Number of people waiting at bus/train stops: 624
Number of bikes: 278
