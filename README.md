# demographic-bike-research
This repo contains a simple HTML/Javascript program that can be ran on a cellphone. The point of this is to do demographic research on high pedestrain areas, using a simple method of recording people and usage while riding a bicycle.

The inspiration of this project came from recent comments and trend within the city of Minneapolis that seem to indicate a strong affinity for the citizens to remove all traffic from Nicollet Mall in Downtown Minneapolis. I am a bus driver for Metro Transit and I have a strong feeling that this would be counter productive in making the downtown corridor better for bicycles, people with disabilities, and especially people of a different race/ethnicity other than standard white people. 

The hopes for this project is to reflect a true narritive of Nicollet Mall. 

Furthermore, Nicollet Mall received a $50 Million revamp to make it the way it is today, and even today there are several items that are missing from the street that make it unpleasant. First, this is a bus cooridor, but the buses are required to be slow, and often hit stop lights that increase delays by significant margins. The fact that the buses are capped at 10mph is not truely accurate as each bus is required to stop at every block for 12 blocks for an average of 30-45 seconds at each light. This means that on average the bus is about 6 minutes late at the end. A better and much more pleasant ride would be one in which the bus stops at each intersection, allowing people to board or disembark, but not requiring the bus to wait at the stop light. Then replacing the stop light with a simple all way stop sign. Furthermore, there needs to be increased signage for the street indicating the street is only for bus, bikes, and pedestrians. Currently people drive through, luckily most traffic is slowed down by the buses (which is actually part of the design).

Then there is the cross traffic for nicollet mall which are giant highway width roads designed for massive capacities, that simply do not exist.

Recent traffic studies show that the all of the streets that cross nicollet mall are below 10000people/day, but yet are built for 45000 people/hr. This suggests that nicollet mall should and remains to be a vital pedestrian cooridor, but the idea of making this cooridor only for pedestrains foolish. Better ideas for Nicollet mall include literally closing most of the cross streets, or converting all of the cross streets into 2 ways with stop signs at every intersection. This would provably result in higher and safer foot traffic being funneled into nicollet mall. 

Depending on the outcome of this study the removal of the buses may be a racist action that largely targets minorities, seniors, disabled people. The discussion of removing the buses from nicollet mall should be carefully analyzed and I don't see anyone else doing the work, so I shall do it.

This study will be performed on August 21st between 6am and 7pm all day long I am going to ride my bike up and down Nicollet Mall with my ebike.

# Analysis
From about 7AM to about 10PM I recorded about 3000 people. I noticed that it was actually much more busy on the mall than I initially expected.
The counting was rather difficult and I missed a significant number of people from bus stops and the light rail station. Typically the people from both modes of transport bolted away before I could count them accurately. I tried my hardest, but when the train drops off about 150 people at one time, its pretty difficult to count them accurately. This also happened often with the D line as the bus was usually full. 

Overall though the data is rather accurate however, but it might undercount the number of transit users, since it was difficult to count all commuters from bus and train dumps. Furthermore, it was difficult counting the number of elderly people, since I often couldn't tell people's age very quickly. For the most part if someone had white hair and walking slower I would count them as senior. All children under the approximate age of 15 are counted as Youth.
Bikes were very easy to count. People with obvious mobility problems (such as wheelchair use) were counted towards "disabled" category. 

There were a few people milling about, these people were counted multiple times, but can likely be filtered out with further research. For the most part though, people were on the move. Very few people waiting and milling about for leisure. I believe this is also true since the mall has very few places to sit and relax (this is a topic for further discussion for later).

Overwhelmingly I was suprised by the amount of people that I saw on this cooridor, this small slice of time does not account for people riding on buses or trains through the street. 

The methodology I used was simple, I pass by them, If they were about 15 feet from me and using the street, I counted them. I typcially just followed the buses and did not pass the buses, since doing so I would usually miss people getting off the bus/transfering buses/waiting of buses.

Between 7am and 10am on August 21, 2024 on a clear nice day this is the count that I found
Number of stray cars: 20
Number of persons: 3584
Number of adults: 3274
Number of children: 151
Number of seniors: 104
Number of disabled persons: 55
Number of white persons: 1884
Number of black persons: 927
Number of asian persons 62
Number of other race persons: 711
Number of non-white presenting persons: 1700
Number of people walking: 2682
Number of persons waiting for bus or train 624
Number of bikes: 278
Number of white persons using transit: 163

As of the 2020 census the City of Minneapolis had the following demographics:
Total population: 429954
total number of white people: 255704
Total number of children: 34808
Total number of seniors: 21180
4.2% of the population has ambulatory disabilty

According to the census the population of Minneapolis 59.47% white, or 40.53% is non-white presenting

According to the small census that I compiled of Nicollet mall, 52.57% of the population is white, or 47.43% is non-white presenting

This supports my hypthosis that the population that uses Nicollet mall skews towards the non-white population. Therefore closing nicollet mall would have a disproportionate affect on people of color. 
Furthermore, in this research it was found that only 26.12% of the people using the transit were white, meaning that 73.88% of the people using the transit on nicollet mall are non-white presenting.
This high number of non-white people using transit indicates that the buses and trains are bringing a higher amount of integration into Nicollet mall. Furthermore, the higher number of non-white people using transit indicates that removing the transit options from Nicollet Mall should be considered to be a racist and systematic effort to exclude non-white people from using the downtown cooridor of Minneapolis.

Furthermore, part of the effort for this research was to determine the number and frequency of stopping at stop lights for the buses to determine an average delay for the buses to see if the buses should have some sort of transit signal priority, or a complete removal of the stop lights and replacement with all way stop signs. According to analysis of the "Census_ride.gpx" in the researchFiles directory I stopped at an intersection on Nicolet mall 82 times during this ride, this is compared to total of 140 times that I encountered a controlled intersection on nicollet mall. Meaning that on average a bus has 58.57% chance of stopping at a light on nicollet mall. On average each light cycle is 30-45 seconds. Meaning that on average a bus will be delayed a maximum of 450 seconds (7.5 minutes) to completely on time, but on average a bus will be late 263.565 seconds (4.39 minutes). According to metro transit there are about 17 people riding a bus at all times (please note this is an average, some buses might be fully packed, some might be empty, such is the case when bus bunching occurs). As of the day that I completed this study there were 668 total buses planned for going all the way up and down Nicollet mall. This means that 668 buses will be late an average of 4.39 minutes. This equates to about 74.67 minutes of reduced economic capacity per bus per delay of Nicollet mall stop lights (this is according to an average of 17 people per bus being late per bus). Furthermore, this is noted as a 49884.069 minutes for the day of lost economic output from the buses stopping at so many of the stop lights. This is equivalent to 34.64 24 hour days per day of lost economic activity due to the buses never being on time due to constant stopping at the stop lights on Nicollet mall. Considering that aproximately 73.88% of all of the people using the buses were non-white persons. This is equivalent to 25.59 days of lost productivity for non white people, and a loss of 9.05 days of productivity for white people in the city of Minneapolis.

# Conclusion
The city of Minneapolis has been considering the removal of buses from Nicollet Mall for about a year and is going to be conducting a feasibility report on this later this year as a way of revitalization of Nicollet Mall. 
But this small census found that the buses do extremely well at integrating the different races of the city into one street. While the racial make up of the city wasn't fully represented in this census, as non-white people still accounted for 10% more of the population on Nicollet Mall than the standard population of Minneapolis, this is still pretty good.
Racial integration is a very good thing, and helps in reducing economic inequalities, reduces discrimination, promotes social cohesion, improves economic mobility, supports mental health well being, among a multitude of other benefits. 
As is the case with Nicollet mall, buses seem to support better racial integration than with any other mode of transportation. This might be due to buses being available to the public, with free options and reduced payment options for people of lower economic standing.
Therefore, the idea of removing the buses from Nicollet Mall should not be considered by the city of Minneapolis as they are too important for equalizing and promoting racial equity.

Furthermore, the idea of removing the buses from Nicollet Mall maybe considered a racist and inherently unequal measure that the city can perform. The city of Minneapolis should not remove the buses from Nicollet mall. 

Beyond the idea of racial integration, buses seem to perform several other interesting uses on Nicollet Mall. They also seem to reduce traffic speeds and prevent stray vehicles from speeding down the street. They also travel slow enough that many people feel comfortable biking down the street. The only real downside I can see with operating the buses on Nicollet mall, is that they are ran on diesel. Instead of just getting rid of the buses on Nicollet Mall, methods should be done to reduce the pollution from the buses, this can be through the conversion of trolley buses, or battery electric buses, which seem to be the current future of the bus network. Furthermore, to reduce the amount of pollution from the buses, the city could instead remove all of the stop lights that cross Nicollet Mall, replacing them with all way intersections. The city could also perform actions such as increasing the number of white people using the buses by reducing automobile incentives in the downtown cooridor. This can be done by making more bus lanes, removing all of the large one way streets with 2 way center turn lane streets, and by significantly increasing the funding for the bike infrastructure on the cross streets.

Nicollet Mall as it is currently supports a large number of pedestrians already with a high degree of racial integration, the buses are safer than ordinary traffic, and allow for faster bicycles, and allows for more people to come to nicollet mall using a significantly smaller carbon footprint than if the same number of people were to drive then walk to Nicollet Mall. 

Instead of removing the buses from Nicollet mall, more traffic calming and lane removal options for streets crossing Nicollet Mall should be explored.
